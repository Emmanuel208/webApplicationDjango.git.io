## Documentation

In this project I made used of pycharm as my IDE. Using pycharm, I was able to impliment Django into my work.
Django has built in app and reasouses which I made use of to the best of my understanding.
I was able to create a web application that had a database, login as an admin/super-user and login as a normal user, create a system where passwords could be recovered in the case where one has forgotten their password. I followed the giving step and instructions that lead me to making the application.By adopting these step, I was able to created a fully working application with database connectivity with user date storable. I used mysql as my datebase.

## Modifications

I made a few changes and modifications to the code. In order to make this code mine, I added background colour to a few elements in the app and I also implemented border lines to some button to give it a more alive look. I also changed the fonts of a few elements and made some line bigger than others. My intention was to give a sense of presidencies to the look of the code.


## Challenges 

During the process of my modifications, I tried to create a directory that would store all my css code for my colours. It was made but I found it hard to call this function into the main code. At the end of the day, I wrote this colour code within the html blocks instead, however this may not have been the best practices but it was what I had to work with at the moment.

## Conclusion 
In all I learn a hand full of new things. I never used PyCharm or Django before and it was a very eye-opening experiment. I am fully capable on taking my knowledge to greater heights with the basic information I have been giving.
